# Harvard Pathfinder

A group effort between Freshmen Sean Coleman, Christian Kardish, 
Christian Ondaatje, and Robert Shaw to create an iOS game with 
pathfinding implemented with the A* algorithm

Pathfinder is an application for iPhone programmed in Swift. 
To compile and run pathfinder, it must be built with 
Xcode6.3.1. To build pathfinder, open pathfinder.xcodeproj 
in the code directory. This will open up an XCode 
project (the files for our direct code are inside the 
pathfinder subdirectory). The application can be run on 
either the iPhone or the iPhone simulator provided by 
XCode6. To use the simulator select iPhone6 from the menu 
in the top left corner. To build to an iPhone plug an 
iPhone into your computer and select the corresponding 
option. To build, simply press the “start button” in 
the top left corner. Once the app is launched,  touch the 
“start pathfinder” icon to begin the game. The enemies 
will chase the hero. Simply avoid the enemies by 
pressing on the hero and dragging him around the obstacles. 
Shoot the enemies by tapping the screen in the 
direction of the shot.
